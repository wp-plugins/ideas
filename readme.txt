== Description ==

Ideas is an extremely simple way to manage ideas in your WordPress admin.

I used to just use WordPress' default "Draft" feature to manage post ideas, plugin ideas, etc. But I was always afraid I'd accidenally publish a draft, and the drafts are included right within the rest of the posts.

It's a messy solution, and far from ideal.

"Ideas" is a step in the right direction, a super simple post type I've been using for a while to keep my ideas separate from my content and media. 

I made a plugin for myself so I didn't have to re-write the post type every time I set up a new site, and also so that my Ideas post type was theme-agnostic.

This is that plugin, and I've got lots of plans to make it better!


== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation, and then activate the plugin from plugins page. 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I wish the most recent ideas would display first, not the oldest ones. =

Just click the "Date" column header to change the order of the ideas based on time. 

= Are the ideas public? =

The ideas you create will only be visible in your WordPress admin, unless you specifically edit plugin code or add a query somewhere for the "ideas" post type.

= Can it do [insert feature name here]? =

Ideas is meant to be very, very simple, so there aren't many features / capabilities. It's just a custom post type I use on almost every WordPress site of mine.

= Why isn't it working? =

Try setting `WP_DEBUG` to `true` and see what errors pop up. If that doesn't help, see the plugin info for how to get support.
