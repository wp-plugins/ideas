== Description ==

Ideas is an extremely simple way to manage ideas in your WordPress admin.


== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and upload the contents to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation, and then activate the plugin from plugins page. 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I wish the most recent ideas would display first, not the oldest ones. =

Just click the "Date" column header to change the order of the ideas based on time. 

= Are the ideas public? =

The ideas you create will only be visible in your WordPress admin, unless you specifically edit plugin code or add a query somewhere for the "ideas" post type.

= Can it do [insert feature name here]? =

Ideas is meant to be very, very simple, so there aren't many features / capabilities. It's just a custom post type I use on almost every WordPress site of mine.

= Why isn't it working? =

Try setting `WP_DEBUG` to `true` and see what errors pop up. If that doesn't help, see the plugin info for how to get support.


== Screenshots ==
